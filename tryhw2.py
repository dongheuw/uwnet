# 7.6 Question: What do you notice about training the convnet with/without batch normalization? How does it affect convergence? How does it affect what magnitude of learning rate you can use? Write down any observations from your experiments:

# With the same setting of all hyperparameters, without batch normalization, I got a test accuracy of 0.402; with batch normalization, I got a test accuracy of 0.541. I could see that with batch normalization the training requires less iterations to converge to a loss value, so batch normalization accelerates convergence. I could use larger learning rate with batch normalization because the training is more stable. With the same setting other hyperparameters, when I used learning rate as .1 for 300 iterations, and then learning rate as .01 for 200 iterations (the total number of iterations is still 500), I got a test accuracy of 0.553, which was the best I could get.
